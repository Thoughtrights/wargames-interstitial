## Caveats

I typically run `*.cgi` as a Python executable within my Apache
http. There's no particular reason why this needs to be Python. It's a
tiny amount of code. Javascript would be just as good. The CSS is
doing the heavy lifting here FWIW. I added a .htaccess as an example
for what you'd have in your Apache config.

If you want to extend it or add any structure to it and keep it as
a Python w/cgi it should be refactored. It's really just script to
dump the datafile.
