Just a little interstitial WOPR for your life.


## Caveats

I typically run `*.cgi` as a Python executable within my Apache
http. There's no particular reason why this needs to be Python. It's a
tiny amount of code. Javascript would be just as good. The CSS is
doing the heavy lifting here FWIW.

If you want to extend it as a Python w/cgi it should be refactored a
bit.
